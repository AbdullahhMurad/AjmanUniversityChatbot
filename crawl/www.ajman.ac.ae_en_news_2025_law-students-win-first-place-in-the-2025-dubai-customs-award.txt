Law Students Win First Place in the 2025 Dubai Customs Award
Monday, May 05, 2025
In a remarkable achievement that reflects academic excellence and social awareness, law students from Ajman University claimed first place in the Dubai Customs Intellectual Property Award for Schools, Universities, and the Community 2025, in the Universities category.
This accomplishment is the result of a collaborative and creative effort by the student team, who produced an awareness film highlighting the importance of protecting intellectual property rights. The film reflected their deep understanding of their legal and social responsibility toward the community.
The film, supervised by Dr. Nasr Abu Fotouh, Associate Professor at the College of Law, focused on raising public awareness about intellectual property and the importance of safeguarding it. The students conveyed clear and impactful legal messages using visual storytelling that resonated with the minds and emotions of young people. They employed a short, narrative style to depict real-life situations that demonstrate the consequences of respecting or violating intellectual property rights.
The project aimed to present simplified and engaging content that explained intellectual property concepts, encouraging respect for creativity and innovation, and showcased real-life examples emphasizing the societal value of protecting such rights. The team sought to raise awareness among students and the community and inspire youth to respect the rights of inventors and creators. Their effort contributes to promoting a legal culture that supports a more conscious and cooperative educational and social environment.
The short film is also expected to increase public understanding of the importance of protecting creative ideas and content, reinforcing the broader societal respect for intellectual rights.
The student team included:
Rashed Al Shamsi, Salem Al Ketbi, Saeed Al Yahyaei, Butti Al Shamsi, Saif Al Shuweihi, Rashed Al Ali, Saif Hussain, Hassan Al Yahyaei, Saud Al Haddad, and Mohammed Al Khair.
They collaboratively took charge of scripting, filming, directing, and producing the film, supported by legal texts outlining the legislative framework for protecting authors’ rights from infringement and violations.
It is worth noting that the Dubai Customs Intellectual Property Award was launched in 2007 as part of the Intellectual Property Rights Protection Department’s strategy to strengthen community engagement in protecting intellectual property. The award aims to educate students about their intellectual rights and how to preserve them. It is organized annually in collaboration with the Ministry of Education and covers all schools and universities in the UAE.
The students expressed their pride in participating in this enriching educational experience.
Saif Hassan described the competition as an inspiring opportunity that helped him gain more confidence in his abilities. He noted, “Winning gave me strong motivation to continue developing my ideas and contribute to society through innovation.”
Mohammed Al Khair emphasized the uniqueness of the collaborative filmmaking process, stating that the team was keen on delivering impactful messages through a visual style that speaks to youth. He added, “We used realistic storytelling to portray the value of respecting intellectual property, and we were proud to translate legal concepts into content that connects with the community.”
This achievement stands as a testament to the students’ creativity and the
College of Law’s
commitment to supporting innovative student initiatives and fostering legal awareness in society. The college played a pivotal role in guiding students to apply their academic knowledge to meaningful, community-based projects, providing mentorship and a supportive learning environment that translates theory into real-world impact.
