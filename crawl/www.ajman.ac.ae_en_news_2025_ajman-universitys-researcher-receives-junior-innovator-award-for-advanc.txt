Ajman University’s Researcher Receives Junior Innovator Award for Advancing Early PCOS Diagnosis in Women’s Health
Monday, Jun 30, 2025
Dr. Sulagna Dutta, Chair of Research and Assistant Professor in Physiology at the
College of Medicine
, Ajman University, has been honored with the prestigious
Junior Innovator Award
at the 2nd International Conference on Recent Innovations in Biological, Chemical & Clinical Sciences (RIBCCS 2025), held in Malaysia.
Jointly presented by
Manipal University College Malaysia
,
Periyar University (India)
, and the
Microbiologists Society India (MSI)
, the award recognizes young scientists for their impactful contributions to biomedical research. Dr. Dutta was recognized for her pioneering work in infertility research, particularly in the early diagnosis and risk stratification of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). Her research integrates anthropometric, hormonal, and metabolic markers to develop predictive models that support earlier intervention and improved clinical outcomes in women’s health.
Dr. Dutta presented this body of work as an
Invited Speaker
at the RIBCCS 2025 conference, delivering a talk titled:
“Predictive Risk Assessment Model for Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) Using Anthropometric, Hormonal, and Metabolic Parameters.”
The presentation highlighted her AU-funded research aimed at developing diagnostic tools that could transform clinical practice in reproductive medicine.
“Receiving the Junior Innovator Award is both an honor and a responsibility,” said Dr. Dutta. “It affirms the significance of our work in addressing one of the most underdiagnosed conditions in women’s health. This recognition strengthens our commitment to advancing research that can lead to earlier diagnoses, more effective interventions, and ultimately, a better quality of life for women affected by infertility and PCOS.
PCOS affects 1 in 10 women globally, yet many remain undiagnosed for years. Dr. Dutta’s predictive models offer a promising pathway for earlier, more accurate screening, potentially improving fertility outcomes and long-term health interventions across the region.
Dr. Dutta’s international recognition builds on her impressive academic profile, which includes a
#2 Expertscape ranking in Malaysia
in reproductive health and her inclusion in the
Top 2% of Scientists worldwide
by Stanford University’s Global Ranking since 2020.
This achievement further reinforces Ajman University College of Medicine’s mission to advance
evidence-based, community-centered healthcare education and research
. Dr. Dutta’s ongoing work exemplifies the college’s commitment to addressing real-world healthcare challenges and enhancing the quality of life through scientific innovation.
