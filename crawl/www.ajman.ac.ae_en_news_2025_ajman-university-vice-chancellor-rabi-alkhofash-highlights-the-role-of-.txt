Ajman University Vice Chancellor Rabi Alkhofash Highlights the Role of Academia in Advancing Real-World Sustainability at PMI MENA Webinar
Friday, Jul 11, 2025
Mr. Rabi Alkhofash, Vice Chancellor for Financial and Administrative Affairs at Ajman University, was recently invited to speak at a regional webinar hosted by the Project Management Institute – MENA Chapter, titled
“Beyond the Buzzwords: Real Sustainability, Real Impact.”
In his remarks, Mr. Alkhofash offered a thoughtful perspective on how universities can meaningfully contribute to national and global sustainability goals through action-oriented strategies.
Drawing on Ajman University’s own journey, Mr. Alkhofash emphasized the importance of moving beyond rhetoric to implement tangible, scalable initiatives. He noted that institutions of higher education are uniquely positioned to nurture the next generation of sustainability leaders—by integrating sustainability into academic programs, institutional operations, and community partnerships.
Mr. Alkhofash advocated for stronger collaboration between academia and industry, underscoring the need to transform theoretical knowledge into real-world solutions. He highlighted the value of strategic partnerships in delivering social and environmental impact, and in preparing students to tackle complex sustainability challenges across sectors.
In his address, Mr. Alkhofash also stressed that meaningful sustainability requires community engagement at its core. He pointed to transparency, volunteerism, and data-informed planning as foundational elements of long-term success.
Importantly, he called for a broader set of success metrics, beyond the traditional focus on carbon reduction, to include indicators such as stakeholder engagement and cross-sector collaboration. These, he explained, are critical to measuring institutional sustainability maturity.
While acknowledging the challenges of translating vision into outcomes, Mr. Alkhofash reinforced the idea that sustainability, when approached strategically, can be both transformative and cost-effective. His message was clear: universities must lead by example, embedding sustainability across their culture, policies, and partnerships to create lasting impact.
