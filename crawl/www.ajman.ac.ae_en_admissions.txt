Marah Damdoum
Dentistry student, AU Ambassador, and Intern at the Chancellor’s office
Upon becoming an AU Ambassador, my passion for public speaking was enhanced as I took part in hosting various events at AU. As an intern at the Chancellor’s Office, I gained a greater appreciation for the amount of work involved in strategic planning and how solutions are found to better the University.”
Bilal Maher Abu-Shwareb
Dentistry student, Former Student Council member, and AU Ambassador
Being part of the Ambassadors’ Program and a member of the Student Council pushes me to be more social and active. Being involved in activities, such as the Honors Assembly, was something truly unique. Helping to organize the event brought me joy. It was really a big step ahead in my life which I will never forget.”
Ali Alhashimi
Pharmacy student, AU Ambassador, and President of the Iraqi Community
“Ajman University is a place that gave me the experience I needed to face life; the power I needed to handle problems; and the confidence to always step forward. We all know that university life changes people, and AU made me a more successful person, especially through my participation in many events which took me to a higher level of success.”
Fatima ElZahra Sayed ElMahdi
Pharmacy student,AU Ambassador, and Vice President Go Natural Club
“Not only did I have the pleasure to be part of various extracurricular activities, but I also participated in public speaking. Being a part of the Ambassadors is one of many reasons I’m truer to myself. And every time I’ve sought advice, the Student Life team has been there for me. Not only have I learnt to be more compassionate, but also more outspoken and confident.”
Abderrahmane Mezdidioua
Finance student,Former Student Council member, current Student Ambassador, and Chief Editor of Meem Times magazine
"The journey of the university was a life changing step for me. I am a senior finance student and I have been through many hardships in my studies. However, I would like to assure you that it has been one roller coaster ride that took 4 years to get through, although it really doesn't feel like 4 years. So, my advice to you is that make sure you seize every single moment of your student life, because I guarantee you, you will miss it!"
Farida Abdunabi
Dental Surgery student,and Student Ambassador
“Time management has never been my strong suit, so participating in the Global Day, while balancing my studies, seemed impossible. It is a decision that I don’t regret though as it allowed me to gain various skills and meet people who I still to this day, call my good friends. Extracurricular activities have become my outlet away from stress, and will continue to participate in the near future.”
