Medical Check up Instruction
As part of the registration requirements at Ajman University, a student medical checkup is mandatory.
The Medical checkup form is available in the AU medical clinics, or through the AU website -
click here to download Medical checkup form
.
This form should be taken by the student to any hospital to be filled in by the doctor in the hospital / Medical Center of the student’s choice.
The medical form should have the student’s registration file number, or the university student’s ID e.g. (202… and a student photo clipped on the form).
The office of Medical Services made some arrangements with some hospitals to provide the fitness certificate / Medical checkup at a very affordable price for AU students.
Ajman Specialty Hospital- AED 150
Amina Healthcare Group - AED 175 Only
Thumbay Hospital – AED 165 Only
Once the medical test is completed, filled and stamped by the doctor/physician, the student should collect his medical fitness certificate
(medical checkup main page with the student photo)
and submit it on ORS – E Request following the cycle below:
Login to:
ors.ajman.ac.ae
> go to
"All Requests"
on the left pane menu > Click on
New Request
> then select >
"Request Category"
field – select
Admission
> Go to Request type select > "
Submission of the Medical Checkup Report Document"
> then proceed.
Once the request has been submitted, the office of Medical Services will validate the document, then will send it to office of Admission & Registration, and student will receive a notification of completion.
The request is submitted through ORS to Office of Medical Services, then to Office of Registration to complete the student’s file.
If the submitted medical checkup is incomplete, the Office of Medical Services will reject the request and will notify the student to complete the document, then re-upload by following the same procedure mentioned above to get approval.
Students living outside the Emirate of Ajman
can hand over the medical form to the nearest hospital to get this medical test done at their convenient place, including the hospitals mentioned above.
Students residing outside UAE
are required to get their medical test done in any hospital in UAE.
No medical test performed outside UAE
will be accepted/approved by Ajman university – Office of Medical Services.
The Fitness Certificate is one of the Admission & Registration requirements as well as the AU office of medical services to keep the students’ records.
