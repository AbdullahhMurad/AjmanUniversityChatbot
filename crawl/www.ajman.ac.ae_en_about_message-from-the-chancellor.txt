Message from the Chancellor
Chancellor Karim Seghir, Ph.D., welcomes students, faculty, and staff to a groundbreaking institution with a 32-year history of innovation and excellence.
The first private university in the UAE – and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) at large – AU has been blazing a trail of excellence since 1988. Our University produces exceptionally prepared professionals while also developing and disseminating vital research and knowledge to the public at large. The commitment and expertise demonstrated by AU stakeholders have transformed the lives of more than 38,000 alumni and continues to serve more than 6,000 students each year.
As AU commemorates 35 years of educational excellence, we honor the compelling vision, the constructive wisdom, and the invaluable support of our Board of Trustees, led by His Highness Sheikh Humaid bin Rashid Al Nuaimi, Supreme Council Member and Ruler of Ajman.
AU’s high standards are demonstrated across a cross-cultural environment in a variety of ways: relevant scholarship; a strong respect and appreciation for diversity; a robust culture of integrity, governance and continuous improvement; a lasting impact on the community, effective corporate connections, and invaluable alumni engagement.
Each of AU’s 39 programs - 24 undergraduate and 15 graduate programs (including 2 doctorates), all of which are accredited by the UAE Ministry of Education, as well as other diverse training programs, offer academic rigor and hands-on experience. Our programs are tailored to the global market, producing research with an impact, while our extensive global alumni network creates an international intellectual environment for stakeholders. The University’s relevant and innovative curricula are designed to set the foundation for lifelong learning. In 2020, Ajman University became
one of the first six higher education institutions in the world
to receive global accreditation from the Quality Assurance Agency (QAA), the UK’s independent body and a global leader in quality assurance for higher education.
AU is also known for its deep sense of social responsibility to underserved and vulnerable populations. Our students regularly participate in community assistance programs at home and abroad. What sets us apart from other institutions is our unique culture of innovation and compassion. Our efforts have been acknowledged and affirmed by a Five QS Stars rating for social responsibility. We further earned Five QS Stars for our inclusive environment and our world-class faciltilies.
AU offers a rich mix of international faculty from 35 countries and a student body composed of 72 diverse nationalities. The 2026 QS World University Rankings puts AU at #1 in the
UAE for
international students, and 17 in the Arab Region.
All our rankings and accreditaitons can be seen here.
When AU graduates join or re-enter the workforce, they are equipped with critical thinking skills, open minds and rich imaginations cultivated through our foundation courses and a rich array of co-curricular activities. Those who graduate from our programs are innovative, ethical and well-rounded professionals with a deep understanding of the realities of the global market.
Whether you are a prospective faculty, student or partner, I am confident you will be impressed with the inspiring intellectual environment here.
We welcome you to Ajman University – where the future happens now.
Sincerely,
Karim Seghir, Ph.D.
