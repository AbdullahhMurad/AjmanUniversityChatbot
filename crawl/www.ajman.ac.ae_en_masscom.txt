Dean's Message
In a world that is rapidly changing, with knowledge production doubling in increasingly shorter periods, the College of Mass Communication, building on its three-decade history and aligned with the university's strategic plan, has committed itself to creating an academic environment that fosters thought, encourages creativity, and inspires innovation. Our mission is to prepare graduates capable of competing in the modern world, a task that places great responsibility on all stakeholders in the educational process—beginning with the student and extending to the faculty, who must unleash their students' potential, enabling them to build on a solid academic foundation and equipping them with 21st-century skills to tackle challenges with creative thinking and a conscious professional ethic.
Through a clear vision translated into a strategic plan that aligns with national and international accreditation standards, the College has succeeded in developing its academic programs to include specializations that reflect global trends, such as Integrated Marketing Communications, Graphic Design for Media, and Radio and Television Production.
These efforts have been crowned by achieving international academic accreditation with European standards from the Agency for Quality Assurance through Accreditation of Study Programs (AQAS), a German agency, followed by obtaining accreditation from the Accrediting Council on Education in Journalism and Mass Communications (ACEJMC) in the United States. This achievement positions the College among only five institutions in the Arab region to receive this distinction. It serves as a unique model for attaining international accreditation under both European and American standards, alongside national accreditation, which has enabled us to overcome significant challenges.
At the graduate level, the College has successfully introduced the Master's program in Public Relations and Corporate Communication, distinguished by incorporating Blended Learning, making it the first program in the university to adopt this system. This aligns with the university's technological transformation and the demands of the modern age.
Recognizing the significance of artificial intelligence in today's world, the College has integrated AI applications into its educational, production, and research processes, enhancing the competitiveness of our graduates and supporting their ability to innovate in future work environments.
The College also takes pride in its advanced infrastructure, which includes state-of-the-art radio and television studios, laboratories equipped with the latest software, design workshops, digital photography labs, and virtual reality facilities. These efforts have culminated in the graduation of exceptional media professionals who contribute positively and successfully across various media fields, strengthening the College's active engagement with the community.
Our aspirations remain high, and our dreams even higher. Together, we will work to realize them in the near future, ensuring that Ajman University continues to be a beacon of knowledge and the preferred destination for students across the region.
