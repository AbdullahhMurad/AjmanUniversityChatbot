Dean's Message
I am delighted to welcome you to the College of Dentistry at Ajman University—a vibrant academic community committed to excellence in dental education, clinical care, research, and community service.
Established in 1997, our college holds the distinction of being the first dental college in the UAE. Over the past 28 years, we have grown into a premier institution, with nearly 1,000 students and trainees and the largest dental hospital in the country. Our mission aligns with that of Ajman University: to deliver quality education, foster innovation through research, and provide high-quality oral health services that meet the evolving needs of our society.
We take great pride in offering a dynamic educational environment, led by highly qualified and experienced international faculty, supported by state-of-the-art facilities and a robust patient base that enhances clinical training. Our programs are built on global best practices and are designed to prepare students for real-world challenges in dentistry.
In addition to our comprehensive Bachelor of Dental Surgery (BDS) program, we now offer six specialized postgraduate programs: Master of Science in Pediatric Dentistry, Master of Science in Endodontics, Master of Science in Restorative Dentistry, Master of Science in Orthodontics, Master of Science in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, and Master of Clinical Dentistry in Prosthodontics.
Over the years, we have proudly graduated numerous batches of BDS students, with hundreds of alumni now excelling in their careers across the UAE and around the world. They continue to make meaningful contributions to clinical practice, research, education, and public health—upholding the reputation of our institution globally.
We are also deeply committed to community engagement. Through our award-winning outreach initiatives, our students and graduates have provided essential oral care to underserved communities, reflecting our values of compassion, service, and social responsibility.
Having served as Dean since June 2001, I have witnessed the remarkable evolution of this college—from its early days to its current stature as a leader in dental education. As we look ahead, I remain optimistic about the future and confident in our continued impact on the profession and society.
I warmly invite you to explore our academic programs and learn more about our journey and achievements. It is my sincere hope that you will be inspired to join us and pursue your aspirations at the College of Dentistry.
May ALLAH, the Most Merciful and the Most Benevolent, guide us in our efforts to advance knowledge, serve the community, and contribute to the progress of this generous nation and the greater world.
