Dean's Message
Welcome to the College of Medicine at Ajman University! As the dean of the college, I am thrilled to welcome you to our website and introduce you to our six-year MD program.
Our program is designed for students who are passionate about studying medicine and committed to making a difference in the world. We admit students from high school and provide them with two years of pre-med studies followed by two years of pre-clerkship and then two years of clinical hospital-based rotations. From the 2024/25 academic year we will have a graduate entry option for a North American style 4-year MD.
Our affiliate clinical sites include Sheikh Khalifa Medical City Ajman (SKMCA), Saudi-German Hospital in Ajman and Dubai as well as Amina Hospital Ajman. These sites provide our students with hands-on experience and exposure to a wide range of medical specialties during the last years of the program.
At the College of Medicine, we are committed to providing our students with an excellent education that prepares them for successful careers in various medical and surgical specialties. Our faculty members are experts in their fields and are dedicated to helping our students achieve their goals. We are proud to say that our students and faculty come from all over the world, making us truly international. Diversity and inclusivity are in our DNA, and we believe that everyone has something valuable to contribute.
Thank you for your interest in the College of Medicine at Ajman University. If you have any questions or would like more information about our program, please don’t hesitate to contact us.
Sincerely,
Solomon S. Senok, MBBS (Ibadan), Dip. Acup. & Mox. (Tianjin), Ph.D. (CUHK)
