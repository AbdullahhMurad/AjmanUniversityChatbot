Message from the Chair
Dr. Nahla Al Qassimi
It is my great pleasure to welcome you all to the 3rd International Conference on Education and Mental Health. Our forum theme, Inclusive and Equitable Quality Education, brings to this venue seriously passionate advocates from different parts of the world. The forum aims to provide a platform for faculty, researchers, and others involved in academia and industry to present their views and share their experiences with research that addresses a number of issues confronting education and mental health.
We have an exciting program at this forum that will allow members to reflect upon and discuss the most recent trends in inclusive education, renew friendships and extend our networks, and jointly explore current and future research directions. We hope that you will have a productive forum.
Together, we reframe how quality education can be described and measured. Needless to say, we must look beyond student achievement. Embracing inclusivity today isn't just essential; it's the cornerstone of shaping the better future of education, ensuring every student, regardless of their background or individual abilities, has their seat at the table.
We are optimistic that by sharing the products of innovative interventions and inquiries, we can empower each other in our common aspiration of serving all learners judiciously according to their needs
Thank you in advance for your participation. I am confident that we have an outstanding array of keynote speakers and presenters. Best wishes and I hope you all have an informative conference.
