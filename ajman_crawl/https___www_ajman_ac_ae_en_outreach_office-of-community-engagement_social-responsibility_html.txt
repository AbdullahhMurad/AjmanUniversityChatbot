Social Responsibility
Being socially responsible is part of Ajman University's DNA.  Students here show great passion for their studies and deep compassion toward society.
At AU, lessons from the classroom are put to work in the community. Every semester, students from our programs work in service to vulnerable populations at home and abroad. Dentistry students volunteer their services daily, under the supervision of faculty, in local Ajman clinics as well as on campus. With the recent addition of an AU mobile dental unit, they are now able to assist UAE community neighbors who lack transportation. Whether volunteering overseas or locally, AU students bring their experiences back to campus for studying and sharing. Check out the

website to see AU students in action. Our efforts have been acknowledged and affirmed by a Five QS Stars rating for social responsibility.
