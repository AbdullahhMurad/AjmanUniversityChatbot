Student Success Center
In November 2019, Ajman University (AU) announced the formation of the Student Success Center (SSC) to serve all the students enrolled at the University.
The SSC offers a variety of student-centered services to ensure academic excellence. From free tutoring, and individualized academic coaching to seminars and workshops, the SSC will provide the tools and resources necessary to achieve its mission. The SSC has a mandate that goes beyond employment training and deep into producing competent, confident, and capable professionals who will contribute to developing their society.
Vision
The SSC will help students reach their full academic potential and thrive during their University years.

A string of round-the-table student-faculty meetings to facilitate open lines of communication that help in creating a more collaborative learning environment and increased knowledge; well-rounded graduates
Create a culture of Life- long learning
Structure activities that foster the elements of Life-Long Learning: Critical Thinking, Curiosity, Problem Solving, Leadership, Communication, Collaboration, Information Management, and Adaptability.
Support provided by the SSC
The Peer-Tutoring Program
In the Peer Tutor Program (PTP) high academically performing students are trained as peer Tutors (PTs) and become officially qualified to provide one-to-one tutorial sessions to students who need additional support in some courses.
Students needing support can access the SSC's website and look for PTs who offer support in the courses they need to revise.
