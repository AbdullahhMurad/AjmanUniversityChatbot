Residence Life and Housing
Ajman University's residence is every college student's dream - secure, high-tech and attractive accommodations with unique spaces for studying and socializing. Located right on campus, it's a short walk to classes in the morning!
Residence life at Ajman University is a college experience like no other. My friends and I like to sit in the garden area outside during the winter to enjoy the beautiful weather.
Each floor has a quiet room to go when youâ€™re in need of relaxation, or calm studying. My favorite part is having all my friends around me all the time. It feels more of a home than it does a dorm.
-- Marah Damdoum, AU Denistry Student
