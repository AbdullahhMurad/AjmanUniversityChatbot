Ajman University Hosts Workshop to Enhance Graduate Research Supervision
Wednesday, Jun 04, 2025
As part of its ongoing commitment to academic excellence and research innovation, Ajman University recently hosted an intensive workshop aimed at advancing the graduate research supervision capabilities of its faculty members.
Organized by the Deanship of Research and Graduate Studies (DRG), the one-day workshop brought together academic staff from various disciplines to strengthen both their theoretical understanding and practical approaches to supervising postgraduate students. Through a series of interactive sessions, participants engaged with contemporary supervision strategies, addressed common challenges, and explored emerging best practices in the field.
The workshop was led by renowned higher education expert Chrissie Boughey, Emeritus Professor at Rhodes University and Professor Extraordinaire at Stellenbosch University—both recognized as among South Africa’s premier research institutions. Professor Boughey brought a wealth of international experience and insight into effective postgraduate mentorship.
Key themes covered throughout the program included the supervision lifecycle, roles and responsibilities of supervisors and students, managing expectations, supporting student progress, navigating ethical dimensions of research, and enhancing academic writing guidance.
By equipping faculty with a structured framework and practical tools, the workshop aimed to ensure that graduate students receive the guidance and mentorship needed to thrive—from developing their initial research proposal to successfully defending their final thesis.
This initiative reflects Ajman University’s strategic focus on fostering a vibrant research culture and empowering its faculty to contribute meaningfully to the academic and professional development of future scholars.
