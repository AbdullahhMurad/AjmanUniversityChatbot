Each student is assigned an academic advisor from the College in which the student is enrolled. Advising is a very important element of the credit-hour system and academic advisor remain in close contact with students.
Not only does the advising system help acquaint students with the syllabus, but it also helps strengthens the relationship between the student and the college.
Academic advisors assist student in solving the problems that they face during their academic tenure.
In addition, they follow the students' academic progress throughout their course of study and assist in the selection of appropriate courses prior to the start of each semester. Students are encouraged and sometimes required, to meet their academic advisors regularly during each semester.
