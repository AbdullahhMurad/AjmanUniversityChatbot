Fine Arts
The Office of Student Life at Ajman University launched the Fine Arts Center to promote the artistic and aesthetic talents of students, and develop their skills, such as painting, calligraphy, photography, sculpture and other artistic works. The Centre organizes workshops that provide students with the knowledge, practical skills and tools needed to produce professional art pieces. It is noteworthy that students' work is displayed in various exhibitions and events inside and outside the University.
