CV
Dr. Amine Bahi is an Associate Professor in the College of Medicine at Ajman University, where he teaches Biochemistry, Genetics, and Cellular Neuroscience. He holds a PhD in Biochemistry from the University of Fribourg, Switzerland, and completed postdoctoral training in neuroscience. His research focuses on investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying microRNA-target interactions and their implications for brain development and psychiatric disorders, including addiction, depression, and anxiety. Dr. Bahi employs a diverse range of methodologies, including viral-mediated gene transfer technologies, molecular biology techniques, and animal behavior studies, to explore the molecular and neuronal circuits that regulate behavior related to affective disorders in rodent models.
